        DESCRIPTION 
                "Initial version of Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) 
                 Common MIB module.  This module defines objects which 
                 may be common to all SIP entities. 
                  
                 SIP is an application-layer signalling protocol for  
                 creating, modifying and terminating multimedia  
                 sessions with one or more participants. These sessions 
                 include Internet multimedia conferences and Internet  
                 telephone calls.  SIP is defined in RFC 2543 (March  
                 1999). 
    
                 This MIB is defined for the managing objects which are 
                 common to SIP User Agents (UAs), Proxy and Redirect  
                 Servers, and Registrars.  Objects specific to each of 
                 these entities may be managed using entity specific 
                 MIBs defined in other modules. 
    
                 A User Agent is an application that contains both a 
                 User Agent Client (UAC) and a User Agent Server (UAS). 
                 A UAC is an application that initiates a SIP request. 
                 A UAS is an application that contacts the user when a 
                 SIP request is received and that returns a response on 
                 behalf of the user.  The response accepts, rejects, or 
                 redirects the request. 
    
                 A Proxy Server acts as both a client and a server. 
                 It accepts requests from other clients, either 
                 responding to them or passing them on to other 
                 servers, possibly after modification. 
    
                 A Redirect Server accepts requests from clients and 
                 returns zero or more addresses to that client. Unlike 
                 a Proxy server it does not initiate requests.  Unlike 
                 a User Agent Server it does not accept calls. 
    
                 A Registrar is a server that accepts REGISTER 
                 requests.  A Registrar is typically co-located with a 
                 Proxy or Redirect Server."

             supported by each SIP entity in this system, and which  
             may be required by a peer. Definition of such features is  
             outside the scope of SIP, which only provides mechanisms  
             whereby support for specific features may be signalled or  
             requested. 
    
             For example, a user agent client may require that a server 
             support the 'com.example.billing' feature, which it would 
             indicate in a Require header.  Such a client would have 
             a row in its sipFtrSupportedTable containing the string 
             'com.example.billing'.  Similarly, a server which is 
             capable of handling requests for such features would list 
             the string in its sipFtrSupportedTable. 
    
             If a server does not support the required feature 
             (indicated in a Require header to a UAS, or in a Proxy- 
             Require to a proxy server), the server returns a 420 Bad 
             Extension listing the feature in an Unsupported header. 
    
             Normally the list of such features supported by an entity
