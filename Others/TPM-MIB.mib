        Implementations must populate the table with all possible

        does not support the creation of new metric and protocol

        Because the probe will only populate this table with supported

    DESCRIPTION
        "The type of aggregation being performed for this set of
        reports.

        The metrics for a single traffic flow are selected in the
        perfTable by the tpmReportControlMetrics object.  When such
        metrics are aggregated in this MIB, these metrics are
        replaced by statistical representation of each metric.
        The metrics describing aggregates are constant no matter
        which type of aggregation is being performed. These
        metrics may be found in the tpmReportTable.

        The flows(1) aggregation is the simplest. All traffic
        flows that share common protocol/server/client 3-tuples
        are aggregated together, resulting in a set of metrics
        for all such unique 3-tuples.

        The clients(2) aggregation results in somewhat more
        aggregation (i.e. fewer resulting records). All traffic
        flows that share common protocol/client tuples are
        aggregated together, resulting in a set of metrics for
        all such unique tuples.

        The servers(3) aggregation usually results in still more
        aggregation (i.e. fewer resulting records). All traffic
        flows that share common protocol/server tuples are
        aggregated together, resulting in a set of metrics for
        all such unique tuples.

        The protocols(4) aggregation results in the most
        aggregation (i.e. the fewest resulting records). All
        traffic flows that share a common protocol are aggregated
        together, resulting in a set of metrics for all such unique
        protocols.

        Note that it is not meaningful to aggregate protocols, as
        different protocols have widely varying characteristics. As a
        result, this set of aggregations is complete.

        It is important to note that this value is the number of
