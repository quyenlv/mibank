    DESCRIPTION
        "This MIB is for managing Wide Area Network (WAN) Optimization
        systems. The objective of WAN optimization system is to reduce
        as much traffic as possible on WAN link and improve the
        application response time for various applications, which gets
        affected due to bandwidth, packet loss, congestion and latency
        limitations of WAN link. WAN optimization system is generally
        peer based system. They are located at both end of WAN link and
        peer with each other to perform optimization. This MIB provides
        instrumentation for monitoring statistics for various features
        implemented for WAN optimization. WAN optimization features
        includes TCP protocol optimizations and various Application
        Optimizers (AOs). AOs include SMB AO, HTTP AO, CIFS AO, NFS AO,
        MAPI AO, VIDEO AO, SSL AO and EPM AO.

        Acronyms and Terminology used in this MIB are:
        AO         : Application Optimizer
        TFO        : Traffic Flow Optimization
        SMB        : Server Message Block
        CIFS       : Common Internet File System
        HTTP       : Hyper Text Transfer Protocol
        NFS        : Network File System
        SSL        : Secure Socket Layer
        MAPI       : Messaging Application Programming Interface
        EPM        : End Point Mapper
        RA         : Read Ahead
        MD         : Meta Data
        PT         : Pass Through
        AD         : Auto Discovery
        RTT        : Round Trip Time
        Conn       : Connections
        File Server: SMB/CIFS file server
        peer       : It refers to peer WAN optimization system located 
                     on other end of WAN and registered with this device
                     to optimize the traffic."
