    DESCRIPTION
        "This MIB module is for the configuration of a network
        device on the Cisco Trusted Security (TrustSec) system.

        TrustSec secures a network fabric by authenticating and
        authorizing each device connecting to the network, allowing for
        the encryption, authentication and replay protection of data
        traffic on a hop by hop basis.

        Glossary :

        TrustSec - Cisco Trusted Security

        EAP-FAST - Extensible Authentication Protocol-Flexible
                   Authentication via Secure Tunneling (RFC 4851)

        PAC - Protected Access Credential.
              A credential dynamically downloaded from the Access Server.

        ACS - Access Control Server

        SGT - Security Group Tag.
              A tag identifying its source, assigned to a packet on
              ingress to a TrustSec cloud, and used to determine
              security and other policy to be applied to it along
              its path through the cloud."
