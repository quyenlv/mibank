                    on each VLAN.  There will be one bit in this string
                    for each possible VLAN ID.  Each octet within this
                    value specifies a set of eight VLANs, with the first
                    octet specifying VLAN IDs 1 through 8, the second
                    octet specifying VLAN IDs 9 through 16, etc.  Within
                    each octet, the most significant bit represents the
                    lowest numbered VLAN ID, and the least significant
                    bit represents the highest numbered VLAN ID.  Thus,
                    each possible VLAN ID of the bridge is represented by
                    a single bit within the value of this object.  If
                    that bit has a value of '1', then Dynamic ARP
                    Protection is enabled on that VLAN; Dynamic ARP
                    Protection is not enabled on the VLAN its bit has a
                    value of '0'."
